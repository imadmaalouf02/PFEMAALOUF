
Introduction
============

We are pleased to introduce our project: **Intelligent AI Platform for Automobile Component Management**. The rapid evolution of the automotive industry requires precise, centralized, and intelligent management of mechanical components (e.g., engine, transmission, braking system, etc.). In this context, our project aims to develop an **intelligent platform** based on **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** that facilitates management, analysis, and automated document generation for the technical requirements of these components.

Objective
---------

The main objective is to allow a user (engineer, technician, project manager) to **enter the name of a component** and then **ask questions** or request specific technical documents related to that component. By integrating AI models (LLMs, Retrieval-Augmented Generation), the platform will provide:

- **Detailed information** on the component's requirements.
- **Test plans** to verify and validate these requirements.
- **Automatically generated technical documents** (e.g., technical specifications, validation reports, test sheets).
- **In-depth explanations** for each requirement covering its function, importance, impact on performance, and testing strategy.
